# Tangerine Documentation

Welcome to the Tangerine documentation. This project aims to provide key to Animate in Tangerine, and a flexible Python framework for pipeline and automations around Tangerine.

## What is Tangerine

**Tangerine** is a purpose‑built real‑time animation engine engineered to sustain a true 24 FPS in even the most complex, multi‑character scenes.
It combines GPU‑accelerated skinning, just‑in‑time shader compilation, and predictive motion interpolation to deliver immediate, frame‑accurate feedback—eliminating the need for playblasts.

Built with a modular plugin architecture and a full Python API, Tangerine slots into existing pipelines and provides detailed performance profiling at every stage of your production.

**Tangerine** is the animation tools thats meets animator's confort and performances.

### Key Concepts

to come

## Workflow

Tangerine uses rigs built with [**Mikan**](https://www.citrus-software.com/mikan) rigging toolbox in a .tang file format.
Animators work in Tangerine a **Shot** and save in it a .shot file.
As they work, they can play the animation at 24 fps just clicking the space bar.

As needed, you can export from they work :
    - Playblasts
    - Alembic files
    - Usd files

This workflow makes it efficient and confortable for the Animator to focus on the animation.
References of assets and Mikan usage as a rig builder also helps to update, raise-up production line fluidity between in a production.

## Pipeline Integration

Once the animation is done in Tangerine, you will be able to export data into alembic files or usd files.
These formats allows you to get your animations loaded in other softwares of the industry for rendering, simulating or anything else such as Houdini, Maya, Nuke.
