# Tangerine Documentation

**Welcome to Tangerine, and thank you for your trust!** We promise you won't be disappointed. You'll see, we've done everything to make you feel right at home. With Tangerine, we didn't want to build a general-purpose 3D app, but **a tool dedicated to animation**. Our goal is to create a little paradise for animators, with features crafted specifically for them. Many of these features are common â€” the classics of the animation toolkit â€” while others are completely new, developed by professional animation teams inside a studio over several years. We hope you'll love them too!

**Tangerine is your tool as well**, because we take the best ideas wherever they come from â€” not just from the original studio â€” so please feel free to share your suggestions. We're always listening on our Discord server. Whether you have a question, need tech support, or just want to talk animation in general, come say Hi! **Animation is the passion that brings us together!**

## Performance above all

Before we introduce our animation tools, let's talk performance because long before animators asked for new features, production teams were dreaming of a fast, real-time solution. Getting instant feedback from the software, editing with perfect smoothness, that was the number-one request! So **we pushed the limits** of current solutions as far as we could. Here are the results:

Compared to any other software:
- Tangerine supports 5â€“7Ã— more characters on screen while maintaining **24 fps playback (say goodbye to playblasts!)** 
- Tangerine lets you have 5â€“8Ã— more assets in a shot while keeping **interaction smooth**

There's no magic. To reach this level of performance, Tangerine uses a *Frame Cache*: on every frame, all the assets that make up the shot have their rigs evaluated and stored in a cache. Modern tools all use caching, but Tangerine's results come from deeply optimized cache management, which brings us to the last performance pointâ€¦

After an interaction, computing the cache creates a period during which 24 fps playback isn't possible. You need to wait a bit before playing the animation to see your edit take effect. This downtime grows with rig complexity (number of evaluations). In Tangerine, it's almost nonexistent (about 0.25 to 0.8 seconds), while in other software it's a significant cost (several seconds!).
Tangerine therefore feels nearly instantaneous, delivering a uniquely fluid workflow. Choppy animation work is over, **the interaction lag is gone!**

Thanks not only to its dedicated animation tools but also to its unmatched performance, 72 hours of animation were produced in 5 years with Tangerineâ€”352 episodes across 10 series.

**Fast. Dedicated. Proven.** These are Tangerine's three pillars.

## Features Overview

Timeline, Curve Editor, Layers and Channels are the basics, any animator would need them and Tangerine offers them of course! So here are some rare features that makes Tangerine truly unique, the little paradise for animators, but the real thing is that: **Tangerine is more than the sum of its parts**. Indeed, in Tangerine there is **no external plugins dependence**, so each features can go beyond what you usually find: the Asset Manager can check for constraint-dependencies in assets unload, the Library pose and animation clips can embark constraints between assets, etc. External plugins rarely talk to each other, this is the major drawback of plugin-based architectures, Tangerine can go beyond because its **features are all native and thus can embrace a synchronized logic**.

- **Per-viewport display Tags**
- **Smart Asset Manager**
- **Supercharged Library**
- **Awesome Motion Trail**
- **Frame-accurate Dynamics**
- **Constraints as simple as saying "Take" or "Drop"**
- **Flip/mirror Poses/Anims, IK/FK Switch, Space Switches...**
- **Shader Checkers**
- **Blocking Mode**
- **Fix Anim with Clusters**
- **Crowd Assets** with baked animation clips

## The Perfect Workflow

Get the most of best worlds:

### 1. Rig in Maya

with our Open Source solution

WIP ðŸš§

### 2. Animate in Tangerine

Layout, shortcuts, but also full Python scripting to develop your own animation specific tool or for pipeline integration! See the Developer Guide.
Playblasts for validation from the animation supervisor or the movie director, but don't playblast all the day long for yourself thanks to the 24 fps playback of Tangerine!

WIP ðŸš§

### 3. Export to Alembic or USD

 to FX and Render departments
